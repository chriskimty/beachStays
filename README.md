# Beachstays: A Multi-Page PSD Conversion Project

## Description

[Beachstays](https://welcome-to-beachstays.netlify.app) is a multi-page PSD conversion project that utilizes HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript to create a functional, accessible, and responsive website, providing a good user-experience across multiple devices and screen sizes.  

Three desktop PSD files were provided: homepage, blog, and contact page, as well as all the original assets/images. Since no mobile design was supplied, this project features a desktop-first responsive design, utilizing necessary breakpoints from large desktop to mobile (responsive down to 320px). The project fulflils all the project requirements including uses of:
* Media queries
* Flexbox and wrapper
* SASS variables and partials
* Functional navigation
* HTML and CSS best practices

The project also includes UI elements achieved with JavaScript such as:
* A functional hamburger menu with a slide-out navigation
* A functional form with a submission confirmation text and refresh button
* An image carousel

This project was completed in September 2022 with [Juno College](https://junocollege.com/)'s Web Development Bootcamp Cohort 44.
