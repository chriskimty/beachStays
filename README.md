# Project 1: Multi-page Site ("Beachstays")

## Description

[Beachstays](https://papaya-alpaca-edc2a9.netlify.app/) is a multi-page PSD conversion project that utilizes HTML and SCSS to create a functional and responsive website, providing a good user-experience across multiple devices and screen sizes. 

Three desktop PSD files were provided: homepage, blog, and contact page, as well as all the original assets/images. Since no mobile design was supplied, this project features a desktop-first responsive design, utilizing necessary breakpoints from large desktop to mobile (down to 320px). The project fulflils all the project requirements including uses of:
* Media queries for responsiveness
* Flexbox and wrapper
* Sass variables
* Accessibility (i.e. form labels, image alt tags)
* Consistent naming convention
* Organization of SCSS partials
* Functional navigation
* HTML and CSS best practices

N.B.: The project will be updated at a later date to include a functional hamburger menu using JavaScript. 

This project was completed in September 2022 with [Juno College](https://junocollege.com/)'s Web Development Bootcamp Cohort 44.
